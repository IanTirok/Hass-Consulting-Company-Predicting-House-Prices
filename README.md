# MchezoPesa-Football-results-prediction
Practice project on Logistic regression, Lasso models, Decision Trees and Polynomial regression

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This week we learnt about Machine Learning. specifically: Multiple Linear Regression, Quantile Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regression.
I will be putting what I learnt to test with this dataset about house prices analysis

I intend to find out whether we can use the independent variables to come up with an accurate price for the houses.

I did not acheive a good prediction with extreme RSME values. However, I believe the models I built are good. More room for improvement. 

* There's more information where that came from follow me for more


### Built With

Here are the major tools that we used for the data analysis

* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Tableu Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://github.com/)
* [Special thanks to google](https://google.com)
* [Special thanks to grepper tool](https://www.codegrepper.com/)
* [Special thanks to Moringa School](https://moringaschool.com/)



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I did this analysis with the intention of improving my skills in machine learning. However, the models used in this analysis could be used by real estate agents, developers and potential buyers to negotiate and price their properties accurately

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Following my analysis I identified some gaps in the data and would like to continue improving the dashboard and analysis in order to come up with a more accurate prediction on footbal game results
.
Some of the data that would have been nice to have are:

1. Better structured datasets. I had a particularly hard time fitting the models to the dataset

### On a side note

Similar datasets for properties in Kenya would be interesting to work on
